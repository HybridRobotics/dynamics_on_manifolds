# Symbolic Algebra Package for Computing Symbolic Dynamics on Nonlinear Manifolds

```

The package symbolic_algebra will compute the dynamical model for a user specified mechanical system.
This file will cover everything from setting up your environment to configuring parameters specific to
your mechanical system.

Below are the steps for downloading scala and setting up your computational environment.


1. Download the latest version of scala at [http://www.scala-lang.org/download/](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/)

2. Install Scala.
 - In Ubuntu 18.04, try `sudo apt install scala`

3. Open command prompt (windows) or terminal (mac/ubuntu). Type scala while in the DynamicalModeling directory. If the scala interpreter does not initialize, you must set environmental variables properly. http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html. Otherwise you can access the interpreter via $INSTALLATION_PATH$/bin/scala.

4. Build dynamics_on_manifolds package. (If still in scala, exit out. The next line is in shell.) `(“$>" marks interpreter prompt)`
 ```
 $> scalac -cp . mechanical_systems/*.scala src/*.scala
 ```

5. Re-enter scala interpreter and type:

```
scala> import dynamics_on_manifolds._
scala> SphericalPendulum.main()
```

The interpreter should ouput the dynamical model.

You have now successfully set up your computational environment and are ready for modeling.



Located in the dynamics_on_manifolds package are a set of starter files, which involve configuration
setups for a variety of mechanical systems. They include:

- SphericalPendulum.scala
- DoubleSphericalPendulum.scala
- Pendulum3D.scala
- DoublePendulum3D.scala
- ThreeLinkWalker.scala
- ThreeLinkWalkerFlight.scala
- QuadrotorWithLoad.scala
- QuadrotorWithContinuum.scala

The symbolic evaluator requires the system's lagrangian, infinitesimal work, and configuration variables.
These are described in detail, particularly in SphericalPendulum.scala. Walk through the set up for this
file for guidance on how to model systems which act on S^2. Pendulum3D will provide useful insight on how
to model a system which acts on SO(3).
